A list of the KPIs required to asses the performance of the company blog:
- See the total number of pageviews of each of the blog posts
- See how popular the blog overview page was
- See which channels performed best in terms of traffic
- See which channels performed best in terms of conversions
- See which posts led to the most conversions
- See the conversion rate of pageviews turning to applications (goal completions)
- See if organic or paid campaigns led to more traffic

The above questions must be presented in a report which lets the stakeholder analyze the results in one glance.
